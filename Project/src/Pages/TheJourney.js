                             It all began in a small town of Mumbai. Surrounded by craftsmen and
                             cobblers, all of them indulged in making the same traditional
                             footwear. Except one. His artistic approach and way to think
                             differently always kept him in the centrepiece. And he called a name
                             for himself as DOKMEN.
